#1 I learnt how to structure a decently large project. 
How to manage it, to break it down to the many pieces the project is composed of, 
and to learn each component after the next.
#2 Organization. 
I learnt that I must organize my code to make it readable, for example, HTML, make my code adhere more to the DOM. More divs. That i should structure my code so I can go back and understand instantly, not having to scan the page for what im looking for.
